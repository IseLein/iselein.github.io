# Daniel Iseoluwa

Hey hey, My name is Daniel, I am a third year computer science student at the University of Toronto, pursuing a Bachelors in Information Security.
I am an aspiring Software Engineer. Previously I was the Vice President of the UTM Robotics Club.

I love solving problems. The journey from seeing an interesting problem, thinking up a solution and implementing it is fulfilling and awe inspiring.
When I am not doing school work, I solve math/coding problems and write programs that provide value to the people around me.

I also love thinking about hard problems in life itself. I find the religious thinkers very profound. I also like watching/playing basketball and football. You can send me a message if you want to talk about any of that.

You can check out my [resume](/My_Resume.pdf).

## Projects

### Personal Projects
- [**Inventory**](https://github.com/IseLein/inventory), *written in Typescript, Next.js*:
When you're 14 years old and you write your first "Hello, World!" in python, what's the next thing you do?
Run to your mum and tell her that you'll build a mobile app and website to help her keep inventory for her book store right? Oh, right.
Anyways, I'm done with the website now ðŸ˜Ž. I'd love to show you but it's private.

- [**Science Hub Blog**](https://github.com/IseLein/science-hub-blog), *written in Javascript, Next.js*:
I built this website for me and my friends to write short articles about various topics that interest any of us.
We could have opened a substack account but why would we do that when I'm a literal software engineer ðŸ¤“.
Eh, I also used it to familiarize myself with the Next js, Node js, MongoDB stack. Read some of our articles [here](https://science-hub-blog.vercel.app/).

### Coursework Projects
- **Chat Server**, *written in C*: I developed a chat server that allowed up to 32 users to send messages securely and synchronously using web sockets
- **Boggle Game**, *written in Java*: I developed a GUI implementation of the famed [boggle game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle) together with a group of 4.
- **Huffman Tree File Compressor**, *written in Python*: I wrote scripts to build huffman tree weights from files and used those weights to compress and decompress the files.
